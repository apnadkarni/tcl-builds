# tcl-builds

Experimental workflows for generating Tcl batteries-included distributions using
BAWT. Still very much a work-in-progress.

**Currently only the Windows Tcl 9 build is known to work**

To do your own builds, clone the repository. On the Actions page, click the
`Tcl/Tk Distribution` link on the left and then click the `Run workflow` button.
A pop-up shows the build options to select platform, Tcl version etc. 

The generated distribution can be downloaded from the `Artifacts` section
at the bottom of the Workflow run page.
